Overview
========================


LSM-Tree全称是 Log Structured Merge Tree，是一种分层，有序，面向磁盘的数据结构，
其核心思想是充分了利用了磁盘的读写特性，即磁盘批量的顺序写要远比随机写性能高出很多


在LSM-Tree里面，核心的数据结构就是SSTable，全称是Sorted String Table，

An SSTable provides a persistent, ordered immutable map from keys to values, where both keys and values are arbitrary byte strings. Operations are provided to look up the value associated with a specified key, and to iterate over all key/value pairs in a specified key range. Internally, each SSTable contains a sequence of blocks (typically each block is 64KB in size, but this is configurable). A block index (stored at the end of the SSTable) is used to locate blocks; the index is loaded into memory when the SSTable is opened. A lookup can be performed with a single disk seek: we first find the appropriate block by performing a binary search in the in-memory index, and then reading the appropriate block from disk. Optionally, an SSTable can be completely mapped into memory, which allows us to perform lookups and scans without touching disk.
