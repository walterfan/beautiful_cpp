How it works
==========================

Redis 是一个单线程程序
* 非阻塞IO
* 多路复用
* 


RESP
----------------------
Redis clients communicate with the Redis server using a protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). While the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, it can be used for other client-server software projects.

RESP is a compromise between the following things:

* Simple to implement.
* Fast to parse.
* Human readable.

RESP can serialize different data types like integers, strings, arrays. There is also a specific type for errors. Requests are sent from the client to the Redis server as arrays of strings representing the arguments of the command to execute. Redis replies with a command-specific data type.

RESP is binary-safe and does not require processing of bulk data transferred from one process to another, because it uses prefixed-length to transfer bulk data.

Note: the protocol outlined here is only used for client-server communication. Redis Cluster uses a different binary protocol in order to exchange messages between nodes.
