Disciplines
==========================
* Understandable

Someone else can pick up the code and fi gure out its purpose and general approach without a walk-through by the original developer.

* Intuitive

Things in the code just seem to make sense, no matter how complex the operation.

* Adaptable

The code is written in such a way that variances in data donâ€™t require a complete rewrite

* Extendable

Care has been given in the code architecture to allow extension of the core functionality in the future

* Debuggable

When something goes wrong, the code gives you enough information to identify the issue as directly as possible.
